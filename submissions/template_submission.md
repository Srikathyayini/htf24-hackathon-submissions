## Project Description    

The Smart Conductor System for buses is a digital ticketing and passenger management solution that allows passengers to generate their bus tickets by scanning a QR code using their smartphones.
This system aims to modernize public transport by replacing traditional paper tickets and manual fare collection with a contactless, automated process. The system enhances convenience, speeds up boarding,
reduces human error, and provides real-time data for better operational efficiency.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of contactless solutions to minimize physical interactions and maintain hygiene in public spaces. 
The traditional exchange of cash and physical tickets posed potential health risks. This project draws inspiration from the global movement toward contactless services, 
aiming to make public transport safer and more hygienic by reducing the need for passengers to handle cash or paper tickets.
